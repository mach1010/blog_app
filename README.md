## Sample blog-app

Follows Michael Hartl's 3rd Edition tutorial of the sample app

I have done this tut before and am doing it again because it covers somewhat different material including minitest and carrierwave which I'm interested in. Also after about a year of tutorials and substantial study in ruby, rails, and other stuff I'm curious to see how much more I will understand.  

I may or may not finish this complete tutorial depending on how much repetition there is from the first time

rails 4.20
ruby 2.0
